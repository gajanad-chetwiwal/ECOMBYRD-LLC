```

## Deploying to Vercel via GitHub

1. Push this repo to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/gajanad-chetwiwal/ECOMBYRD-LLC.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. On [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **Add New Project** → import the repo.
   Vercel auto-detects Next.js; no configuration needed. Deploy.
3. Add your custom domain (`ecom-byrd.com`) under **Project → Settings → Domains**.

## Contact form

The form on `/contact` posts to [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co) and delivers
to `info@ecom-byrd.com`. **One-time setup:** the first submission triggers a
confirmation email to that inbox — click the activation link once and all
subsequent submissions flow through. No backend or API keys required.

## Content

All copy, stats, case studies, testimonials and contact details live in one
file: [`lib/data.ts`](lib/data.ts). Edit that file to change any content on the
site — no component changes needed.
